Email Reports, Logs
=============

The system can send automatic email reports about various activities with the help of `ssmtp <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf>`_ and `cron <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/etc/cron.d/chros73>`_ and you can easily create your own. It also logs every major event to a file.

Reports by Queue Manager
------------------------

`Queue Manager <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/home/chros73/bin/queueTorrent.sh>`_ sends email reports about its regular activity or about various problems.

Regular report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It can include 5 different activities in its regular reports (all of them are configurable and enabled by default):

* deleted torrents by `Disk free space manager <Queue-Manager#disk-free-space-manager>`_
* bogus torrents in ``.queue`` directory by `Downloading queue manager <Queue-Manager#downloading-queue-manager>`_
* duplicated torrents in ``incomplete`` directory by `Downloading queue manager <Queue-Manager#downloading-queue-manager>`_
* oversized torrents in ``.queue`` directory by `Downloading queue manager <Queue-Manager#downloading-queue-manager>`_
* queued torrents by `Downloading queue manager <Queue-Manager#downloading-queue-manager>`_

A possible email report that includes all 3 components looks like this:

* subject: ``U - Making Free space, Bogus torrents!, Duplicated torrents!, Oversized torrents!, Queued 3 torrents``

.. code-block::

.. code-block::

   Free space before action: 5GiB
   
   Error in disk space: deleting from rotating directories wasn't enough... :(
      You have to fix it manually :(

Other useful reports
-------------

These reports use ``rtcontrol`` command from ``pyrocore`` utilities and are created as `bash functions <Additions#extra-bash-functions>`_ in `~/.profile_rtfunctions <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/home/chros73/.profile_rtfunctions>`_ to be able to be used at the command line as well.


Orphaned torrents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It can happen that data of a torrent gets abandoned, consuming only disk space but actually not used by ``rTorrent-PS-CH``.

`reportOrphans.sh <Additions#reportorphans-sh>`_ lists orphaned torrents, runs in every 10 day as a reminder, a possible email report with subject ``U - List of Orphaned torrents`` looks like this:

.. code-block::

   Free space before action: 6.6GiB
   
   There are orphaned torrents, manual interaction is required.
        1.8 GiB - incomplete/Atlantic Anime Blend Ezine
      256.5 MiB - apps/Baen_CD-08-Into_the_Looking_Glass.iso
      912.1 MiB - songs/JPFO 2A Today for the USA MP4

   Orphaned data size: 2.9 GiB



Orphaned meta files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It can happen that meta files of a torrent gets abandoned, not used by ``rTorrent-PS-CH``.

`reportOrphanMetas.sh <Additions#reportorphanmetas-sh>`_ lists orphaned meta files, runs in every 10 day as a reminder, a possible email report with subject ``U - List of Orphaned meta files`` looks like this:

.. code-block::

   Free space before action: 6.6GiB
   
   There are orphaned meta files, manual interaction is required.
      .rtorrent/.completed/rotating/Baen_CD-08-Into_the_Looking_Glass.torrent



Public torrents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since public torrents are officially supported it's good to know which they are and how much disk space they occupy.

`reportPublic.sh <Additions#reportpublic-sh>`_ lists public torrents, runs in every 10 day as a reminder, a possible email report with subject ``U - List of Public torrents`` looks like this:

.. code-block::

   Free space before action: 6.6GiB
   
   There are public torrents, manual interaction is required.
        1.8 GiB - incomplete/Atlantic Anime Blend Ezine   mininova.org
      256.5 MiB - apps/Baen_CD-08-Into_the_Looking_Glass.iso   bt1.archive.org
      912.1 MiB - songs/JPFO 2A Today for the USA MP4   mininova.org

   Public data size: 2.9 GiB



Torrents with unusual tracker message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It can happen that a torrent gets deleted from the tracker, consuming only disk space but actually can not be used by ``rTorrent-PS-CH``.

`reportMessages.sh <Additions#reportmessages-sh>`_ lists torrents with unusual tracker message, runs every day as a reminder, a possible email report with subject ``U - List of torrents with unusual Tracker Message`` looks like this:

.. code-block::

   Free space before action: 6.6GiB
   
   There are torrents with unusual tracker message, manual interaction is required.
        1.8 GiB   incomplete/Atlantic Anime Blend Ezine   mininova.org
            Tracker: [Failure reason "torrent not registered with this tracker"]
      256.5 MiB   apps/Baen_CD-08-Into_the_Looking_Glass.iso   bt1.archive.org
            Tracker: [Failure reason "torrent not registered with this tracker"]
      912.1 MiB   songs/JPFO 2A Today for the USA MP4   mininova.org
            Tracker: [Failure reason "torrent not registered with this tracker"]

   Data size of torrents with tracker message:    2.9 GiB


Stopped torrents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This setup ``never`` stops any torrent, all the torrents are running all the time. If this happens that means something is wrong with those ones.

`reportStopped.sh <Additions#reportstopped-sh>`_ lists stopped torrents, runs every day as a reminder, a possible email report with subject ``U - List of Stopped torrents`` looks like this:

.. code-block::

   Free space before action: 6.6GiB
   
   There are stopped torrents, manual interaction is required.
      256.5 MiB   apps/Baen_CD-08-Into_the_Looking_Glass.iso   bt1.archive.org
      912.1 MiB   songs/JPFO 2A Today for the USA MP4   mininova.org

   Stopped data size:    1.1 GiB


Stuck torrents in ``incomplete`` directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normally, all the data of torrents get moved from ``incomplete`` directory into their final category when their download is finished. If this happens that means that target ``data`` directory/file (in one of the sub-directories of ``main`` directory) OR ``meta`` file (in one of the sub-directories of ``.completed`` directory) exists.

`reportStuck.sh <Additions#reportstuck-sh>`_ lists stuck torrents in ``incomplete`` directory, runs every day as a reminder, a possible email report with subject ``U - List of Stuck torrents in 'incomplete' dir`` looks like this:

.. code-block::

   Free space before action: 6.6GiB
   
   There are stuck torrents in 'incomplete' directory, manual interaction is required.
      256.5 MiB   Baen_CD-08-Into_the_Looking_Glass.iso   bt1.archive.org
      912.1 MiB   JPFO 2A Today for the USA MP4   mininova.org

   Stuck data size:    1.1 GiB


Low rotating space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`reportLowRotatingSpace.sh <Additions#reportlowrotatingspace-sh>`_ reports low amount (configurable in script) of rotating space (in rotating and unsafe directory, including free space as well), runs every day as a reminder, a possible email report with subject ``U - Low Rotating space`` looks like this:

.. code-block::

   Free space before action: 102GiB
   
   There is low rotating space (in rotating and unsafe directory), manual interaction is required:
      668GiB


Creating your own
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can easily create your own report with the help of ``rtcontrol``, this is what needs to be done:

* create a new bash function in `~/.profile_rtfunctions <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/home/chros73/.profile_rtfunctions>`_
* export the new function in `.profile <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/home/chros73/.profile#L24>`_ like the rest are to be able to be used at the command line as well
* copy and modify an existing report script to your needs in `~/bin/ <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/tree/master/ubuntu-14.04/home/chros73/bin>`_ 
* add the new report script to `cron <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/etc/cron.d/chros73>`_

That's it. :)


Logs
----

In addition to email reports ``rTorrent-PS-CH`` can produce log files into ``.log`` directory as well.

Messages log
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Logs various data of download items (``event``, ``title``, ``size``, ``uploaded data``, ``ratio``, ``seeders/leechers`` scrape info, ``loaded time``, ``disk free space``, ``tracker``) during different events and startup time, being logrotated.
