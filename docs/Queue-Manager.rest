Introduction
------------

Don't be scared about the length of this page! :) The idea and its realization is really simple, only the documentation is long. :)

The core concept of the setup is completely based on moving ``data`` AND ``meta`` files all around the place:

* there's a ``.downloading`` directory with ``categories`` (sub-directories) with which ``rtorrent`` will start downloading new torrents (these are the watch directories in `.rtorrent-config.rc <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/home/chros73/.rtorrent-config.rc#L69>`_) 

* when a download is finished ``rtorrent`` moves their ``data`` from ``incomplete`` directory AND ``meta`` files (from one of the sub-directories of ``.downloading`` directory) into their final place (meaning one of the sub-directories of ``.completed`` directory for ``meta`` files and one of the sub-directories of the main directory for ``data``). The ``.downloading`` directories get empty all the time in this way.

* the ``.queue`` directory with ``categories`` (sub-directories) contain ``meta`` files that should be moved into one of the sub-directories of ``.downloading`` dir to be able to start them by ``rtorrent`` when there's free slot in the ``downloading queue``

* there are 3 predefined ``categories/directory`` for ``rotating`` (deleting data) torrents: 

  * ``rotating`` (means ``special`` group) and ``unsafe`` categories
  * ``.delqueue`` directory: it should contain only ``symlinks`` to deletable meta files

* there is 1 special ``category/directory`` called ``load`` for only loading (in closed state) but not starting torrents:

  * priority of files can be set to ``Off``, so they will only occupy the required spcae, and download can be started later (e.g. with ``^s``)

* there's also an `unsafe_data <Additions#unsafe-data>`_ custom variable defined in ``rtorrent`` that makes torrents deletable (value ``2`` means that the torrent is in delete-queue, meaning ``.delqueue`` directory)


Queue Manager
-------------

There's only 1 small `queueTorrent.sh <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/home/chros73/bin/queueTorrent.sh>`_ ``queue manager`` script with ``rotating`` (deleting data) capability and ``category`` support, that realize all the above mentioned tasks.

It contains 2 functionality:

* ``downloading queue manager`` that will queue torrents if there's free slot and free disk space for them

* ``disk free space manager`` that will delete data to make free space for the newcomers

It runs from `cron <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch_setup/blob/master/ubuntu-14.04/etc/cron.d/chros73>`_ in every 5 minutes.


Downloading queue manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moves ``meta`` files from one of the sub-directories of ``.queue`` directory into one of the sub-directories of ``.downloading`` directory, so ``rtorrent`` can start to download them.

* its top priority is that it shouldn't break ``rtorrent`` in any case

* it checks how many meta files are in the ``.downloading`` directory:

  * what the number of ``active downloads`` is currently and moves the appropriate number of ``meta`` files from one of the sub-directories of ``.queue`` directory

* ``size of downloading queue`` and ``order of processing`` are configurable

* it runs disk free space manager every time, even when there's nothing to be queued! (except for when ``rtorrent`` is stopped)

* it can send `email report <Email-Reports,-Logs#reports-by-queue-manager>`_ about all the action that was made (all of them are configurable)

* it doesn't move meta file(s) if:

  * ``rtorrent`` stopped running

  * ``meta`` file is bogus (not valid torrent file), e.g. it has missing ``name`` or ``size`` property

    * it moves ``meta`` file into ``.bogus`` directory and appends current time to the moved ``meta`` filename in this case

  * there's not ``enough disk space`` for the queueable torrents, even after trying to make more

    * it moves ``meta`` file into ``.oversized`` directory and appends current time to the moved ``meta`` filename in this case

  * target ``data`` directory/file (in one of the sub-directories of ``incomplete`` directory) OR ``meta`` file (in one of the sub-directories of ``.downloading`` directory) exists

    * it moves ``meta`` file into ``.duplicated`` directory and appends current time to the moved ``meta`` filename in this case


Note:

* if a ``meta`` file is placed directly into one of the sub-directories of ``.downloading`` directory (watch directories) then downloading will start immediately without the interaction of ``Queue Manager``

  * ``hash-checkable`` ``data/meta`` files should be used in this way:

    * ``hash-checkable data`` should be placed into ``incomplete`` directory and its ``meta`` file into one the sub-directories of ``.downloading`` directory, hash-checking will start immediately

* the categories directory structure has to be created 4 times in this way:

  * in: ``/mnt/Torrents``, ``.queue``, ``.downloading``, ``.completed`` directories



Disk free space manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deletes ``meta`` files from the predefined ``rotating``, ``unsafe`` category directories and from ``.delqueue`` directory, so ``rtorrent`` can delete their data!

* ``rtorrent`` is configured to only delete their data if their `unsafe_data <Additions#unsafe-data>`_ custom variable is set to ``1`` or ``2`` !

* processing order of deleting ``meta`` files is the following:

  * from ``.delqueue`` directory (containing ``symlinks``) in reverse order, oldest first

  * from the predefined ``rotating``, ``unsafe`` category directories in reverse order, oldest first, handling them altogether at the same time!

* enabling this part of the script is configurable, it's disabled by default for safety reason:

  * it can be enabled by setting ``AUTOROTATETORRENTS=true``

* it only should be run by the ``downloading queue manager``

* amount of ``reserved disk space`` is configurable

* it waits for 15 seconds after successful deletion of all ``meta`` files for letting ``rtorrent`` to finish deleting data

* it can send `email report <Email-Reports,-Logs#reports-by-queue-manager>`_ about all the deleted torrents (configurable)

* doesn't delete ``meta`` file(s) if:

  * this functionality is ``disabled``

  * there's ``enough disk space``

  * there's ``nothing to be deleted`` from the defined ``rotating``, ``unsafe`` categories and ``.delqueue`` directory
